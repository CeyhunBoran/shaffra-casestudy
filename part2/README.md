## Issues Found and Solutions Implemented

### Issue 1: Incorrect use of goroutines and WaitGroups

**Problem:** Unnecessary goroutines and WaitGroups were used within HTTP handlers, potentially leading to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

**Why it could cause failure in production:** This incorrect usage could result in inconsistent responses, data corruption, or unpredictable server behavior under load.

**Solution:** Goroutines and WaitGroups were removed. Database operations are now handled synchronously within the HTTP handlers, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.

### Issue 2: Potential SQL injection vulnerability

**Problem:** The createUser function directly concatenated user input into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Why it could cause failure in production:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially compromising sensitive data or disrupting database operations.

**Solution:** Parameterized queries using PostgreSQL's `$1` syntax were implemented, preventing SQL injection attacks by properly escaping user input.

### Issue 3: Lack of error handling

**Problem:** The original code didn't properly handle errors, especially when dealing with database operations.

**Why it could cause failure in production:** Unhandled errors could lead to unexpected crashes, silent failures, or misleading error messages, making it difficult to diagnose issues in a production environment.

**Solution:** Proper error handling was implemented throughout the application. Now, each operation checks for errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes with meaningful error messages.

### Issue 4: Improper use of database connections

**Problem:** The original implementation opened a single database connection at startup but never closed it, potentially leading to resource leaks.

**Why it could cause failure in production:** This improper handling could result in exhausted database connections over time, especially during long-running processes or under high load conditions.

**Solution:** Connection pooling was implemented, and a deferred call was added to close the database connection when the server shuts down. Additionally, graceful shutdown logic was added to ensure clean termination of the application.
