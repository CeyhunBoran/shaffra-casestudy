# Online Marketplace Platform Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This document presents a microservices architecture for an online marketplace platform. It offers a system where users can view products, create orders, and review their order status. Its architecture design meets scalability and fault tolerance.

## Microservices Architecture


### User Service
- Responsible for managing all user-related operations
- Implements authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, JWT tokens, or session-based authentication
- Maintains user profiles, login/logout, handles password resets, and manages user preferences
- PostgreSQL is chosen due to its strong support for ACID transactions, crucial for maintaining data integrity during user authentication processes

### Product Service
- Focuses on managing the product catalog and related operations
- Provides APIs for adding, updating, and retrieving product information
- MongoDB is selected because it offers flexibility in handling varying product attributes and supports efficient querying for product searches and filters

### Order Service
- Responsible for processing orders, managing inventory, and handling payments
- Interacts with payment gateways and maintains order status throughout the fulfillment process
- PostgreSQL is chosen here due to its strong support for transactions, essential for maintaining consistency during order creation and payment processing

## Database Choices

### User Service: PostgreSQL (Relational)
- Justification: Structured user data fits well with relational models. ACID compliance is important for user authentication and profile management

### Product Service: MongoDB (Document-oriented NoSQL)
- Justification: Flexible product schemas benefit from document-oriented structure. Easy to add/remove fields as needed for various product types

### Order Service: PostgreSQL (Relational)
- Justification: Transactional nature of orders requires strong consistency. Relational model suits order relationships and supports complex queries for reporting

## Scaling Considerations

Each microservice can be scaled independently:

1. Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of each service as needed
2. Load balancing: Use application load balancers to distribute traffic across instances
3. Service discovery: Implement a service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul) for dynamic service location

## Communication Between Services

- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate services
- Inter-service communication: Use RESTful APIs or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between services

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. Version control: Git repositories for each microservice
2. Build: Docker containers for consistent environments
3. Test: Automated unit tests and integration tests
4. Deploy: Kubernetes for container orchestration
5. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and visualization

## Additional Components

1. Redis: Used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., product catalogs) to reduce database load
2. Elasticsearch: Optional for advanced search capabilities if MongoDB's built-in search isn't sufficient
3. Logging: Centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack) for easier troubleshooting across services

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based authentication for secure API access
2. Authorization: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions across services
3. Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption)
4. Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting on APIs to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks

This architecture provides a scalable, fault-tolerant foundation for the online marketplace platform. It allows for independent development and scaling of each service while maintaining strong consistency where required through the use of relational databases for critical operations like user authentication and order processing.
